This code does the following :
- Categorize the files according to their types.
   #copy each of them to different folders : jpegFolder, pngFolder, txtFolder , mp3Folder
- Use concurrency methodology to do this job more faster.
   #by calling The function four times in parallel in the background for each type 
- Do a benchmark to show the difference between single thread and multi thread.
   # --> time bash code.sh
   # --> time bash paralled_code.sh
   # The difference between them has been proved & shown in the screenshots
